# B+ Tree Visualization

## Overview

B+ Tree Visualization is an interactive tool for visualizing B+ trees. The application allows you to experiment with different B+ tree operations, such as inserting and deleting keys, and adjusting the maximum degree of the tree. This project is designed to help users understand the structure and behavior of B+ trees through visual representation.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: View and interact with a B+ tree structure dynamically.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Set the maximum degree of the tree and input new keys.
- **Operations**: Add, delete, undo, redo, and reset operations to manipulate the B+ tree.
- **Random Key Generation**: Option to generate random keys for insertion.
